= Plugin Features =

2. Youtube, Vimeo, Quicktime video support<br />
3. Built-in PrettyPhoto gallery for image and video preview<br />
4. Easy categorization and jQuery sort feature<br />

= Usage Instructions =

1. Add portfolio item types under the 'Nimble Portfolio' tab in dashboard such as web, mobile, graphics etc.
2. Add new portfolio items using custom post type under the tab 'Nimble Portfolio'.
3. Add item title (keep it short), add description.
4. Then upload featured image from the far right bottom box. Once the image is uploaded first copy the generated URL from the field ‘Link URL’ then hit ‘use as featured image’ link at the bottom, then close the window. Paste the copied URL in the input field ‘image/video url’ on the left.

= Shortcode =

Insert the portfolio in your page or post with this shortcode

`[nimble-portfolio template="TEMPLATE_CODE"]` (where `TEMPLATE_CODE` is the folder name of template you want to use from templates folder)

Right now there is only one template available "3colround", which is also the default, so you can also use this shortcode `[nimble-portfolio]`
